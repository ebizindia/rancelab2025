			<p>"Initially store was maintained manually. We were facing the problems in stock maintenance as there were thousands of pieces in different design, size and colors. With the help of a barcode based solution which provided by RanceLab® ultimately solved our problems. Now we are getting the essential output in each angle of all products."

			<p>"Before installing RanceLab® store was managed manually. We were having a major problem in maintaining cash and inventory. RanceLab® helped us to maintain the store in an organized way. Sale, purchase and cash is within control now."
			<div class="text-info text-right"><strong>Ajay Mimani – CONVENIO</strong></div></p>
			<hr>
			<p>"RanceLab® has eased our operations by simplifying issues pertaining to tax, inventory, checking previous purchase rates, customer profiles & point accumulation."
			<div class="text-info text-right"><strong>Rakesh Dassani – KAYBEE'S</strong></div></p>
			<hr>
			<p>"RanceLab® is user-friendly software and very simple and easy to operate. We had tried about 3 other software before using RanceLab® and are happy to have made the right decision. It has given me the confidence of opening other stores with all information at my fingertips considering we are running a one-man show. We have already recommended it to a lot of people."
			<div class="text-info text-right"><strong>Manoj Khem – NAUGHTY LINGERIE</strong></div></p>	
			<hr>
			<p>"RanceLab®, I personally feel, has been designed very thoughtfully. It empowers the users with the scientific tools of Inventory management, MIS and CRM – a must for the success of any retailer now days. The more you use it, the more you find it flexible and user friendly. Even better part is the approach of its team members who are always willing to take suggestions from us and improve the software even further. RanceLab® for me is one complete package – satisfaction guaranteed."
			<div class="text-info text-right"><strong>Sumit Jain – SYTLE FORUM</strong></div></p>	
			<hr>
			
			<p>"Prior to the installation of RanceLab® the software which we were using was inaccurate. We were having problems in maintaining stock, purchase, sales etc. in every respect. In one word it not adequate for our business. RanceLab® has sorted out the problems. Implementation of barcoding system by RanceLab® gives a better way of controlling the stock. Now purchase, sales, inventory can be controlled in a systematic way."
			<div class="text-info text-right"><strong>Sanjay Arora – VALUE WORLD</strong></div></p>	
			<hr>
			
			<p>"Using RanceLab® I don't have to bother for stock entries, credit customer's account and total cash collection. Everything is now maintained by just one invoice only and bar-coding helped me to do this easily."
