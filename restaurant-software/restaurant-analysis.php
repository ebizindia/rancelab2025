A completely new approach for reports, designed from the ground-up - FusionResto reports are the ultimate tool for organizing and analyzing your business data. The report\'s main functionality is in its ability to summarize large amounts of information, and represent it in a pivot and cross-tabulated form unlike other business applications that only produce monthly or weekly reports.']

						<h3>Key Performance Indicators (KPI) & Insights</h3>
						<h4>Boosts decision making, drives your business growth</h4>
						<p>A completely new approach for reports, designed from the ground-up - FusionResto reports are the ultimate tool for organizing and analyzing your business data. The report's main functionality is in its ability to summarize large amounts of information, and represent it in a pivot and cross-tabulated form. So, it is the best tool to create financial, stock and statistical reports. For instance, you can analyze sales during specific periods (years, quarterly intervals, months) for each customer or each product category, or you can create a report which will show the top 10 customers, by items purchased. Another example is a report that displays the most or least popular products.</p>
						<h3>Reports with Charts</h3>
						<h4>Converts data to delight</h4>
						<p>These reports allow you to easily reorganize the layout using drag-and-drop. As a result, the business data will be re-summarized according to the new layout of the column and row fields, so you can easily alter a report to display the information they need in the way they need it. The report window provides spreadsheet style access to all data maintained by FusionResto.</p>
						<h3>Customizable Reports</h3>
						<h4>Design your own customizable reports</h4>
						<p>For those of you familiar with Microsoft Excel, this report is very similar. All reports have full query (SQL) capabilities so you can view, customize, filter and group your data and design the reports you need. The report window lets you design views by simply dragging the columns into the order you want, then removing the columns you don't want. It allows you to perform a smart search within the report. After a report is designed, that view can be saved and recalled whenever necessary.</p>						 
						<h3>Export Reports</h3>
						<h4>Export reports, collaborate with third party application</h4>
						<p>These reports are converted to pivot format and vice versa. All the reports are available for export in Excel, Text, PDF, HTML, RTF and CSV for integration with any third party application. These reports are further converted into a data cube and can be viewed on FusionResto interface without SQL Database. There is virtually no limit to the number of views you can design. FusionResto comes with many common reports already pre-designed.</p>
						<h3>Aging and Analysis</h3>
						<h4>Improves decision making, saves time</h4>
						<p>With FusionResto’s advanced aging and analysis, you can review and analyse purchase, sales, customers, suppliers, stock and profit data and make important business decisions carefully and strategically.</p>
						<h3>Reports with Charts</h3>
						<h4>Transforms big data into actionable insights</h4>
						<p>FusionResto analysis reports come with charts for quick and on-time decisions. FusionResto has a few of the industry’s finest KPI that helps you measure and improve efficiency, streamline your business processes even more and make you save on time. FusionResto’s graphs and dashboard widget is one of its kinds and transforms your big data into actionable insights. It lets you visualize the Key Performance Indicators and other strategic data for your organization at a glance. The dashboard tool presents management with the information for the practical end of the organization.</p>
						<h3>Reports Scheduler</h3>
						<h4>Automatically sends reports to your email</h4>
						<p>FusionResto’s report scheduler comes with specially curated pre-defined management reports.
