						<h3>Power of Connectivity and Collaboration</h3>
						<h4>Transforms your business into an intelligent enterprise</h4>
						<p>Highly Scalable FusionResto is implemented in more than one way: host it on a cloud, run it independently on a single system placed in your outlet, use it on multiple network computers in a single outlet, use it across multiple outlets. It will run on-premises as well as hosted on your private cloud or public cloud.</p>
						<p>Connect using Remote Data Service: No need of setting up a database at the branch or laptops of traveling executives. Collaborate multiple geographical locations seamlessly with built-in Team System. Branch accounting, Club multiple locations under the same company.</p>
						<p>With FusionResto you and your co-workers can all work at the same time. Just enter the data and FusionResto saves it on a server where all team members can access it and get to work. It ensures that you do not have to duplicate the work. Team System also ensures that each team member gets to see the relevant data only.</p>
						<h3>Experience the Best Modular System</h3>
						<h4>Specially crafted business modules by industry experts</h4>
						<p>FusionResto is an independent and selective modular solution, that is scientifically designed to increase your sales, reduce costs and leakages. Move beyond the basic billing software. On-premise or in the cloud, FusionResto manages every aspect of your business â€“ from financials and loyalty to supply chain and purchasing.</p>

From improving cash flows to increasing visibility while cutting costs, each individual module is designed to empower your organization growth. Keep adding FusionResto modules at your own pace; it makes all the relevant data online and effective immediately.</p>
						<h3>Enterprise Chain Outlet Management</h3>
						<h4>Connects all your locations in real-time</h4>
						<p>You just need simple dial up or broadband internet connection. No need to have fixed IP or leased lines. The smart client technology allows each location to work independently even if the internet connectivity is lost. Whenever the connectivity is stored it syncs the data automatically with head office. FusionResto multi location brings you enterprise wide connectivity across all of your outlets, central kitchen and back office.</p>
						<h3>Centralized Control</h3>
						<h4>Creates your own fully configurable robust system</h4>
						<p>System information flow, features, working options and default settings are fully configurable. FusionResto uses a simple yes-no type of configuration to adopt the business policy, user or system. Robust security and user permissions determine which transactions, masters and reports features may be created, modified or accessed by each user and user group. You can even set a default screen for the user to specific transactions only. All the settings like printing, options and security are centrally controlled. This means there is Zero Setup at branch location. The setup does not require special skills at the branch location.</p>
						<h3>Occasionally Connected Clients</h3>
						<h4>Carry out outlet operations without worrying about connectivity</h4>
						<p>If you cannot afford to lose sales, customer and revenue just for unreliable internet connection, deploying a web based application obviously won't work. Consider FusionResto. You can carry out all the outlet operations without worrying about the connectivity. Everything gets updated automatically when it gets the next connection.</p>
						<h3>ERP Applications</h3>
						<h4>Integration with ERP Software System</h4>
						<p>RanceLab offers an integration with most advanced and popular ERP systems such as SAP R3, SAP Business One and Oracle ERP System. For large chain or a business with a production unit running on any of the above ERP software may have access to these integration</p>
						<h3>Real-time Synchronization</h3>
						<h4>Real-time synchronization of your enterprise data</h4>
						<p>When the internet connectivity is stable, FusionResto automatically synchronizes the data real-time. This means you do not have to wait for the day to end or manually process the batch of data. The data is automatically synchronized based on the data sending rules. This gives you ultimate control on what data should synchronize. The best part is that no human intervention is required. No manual import and export.</p>
						<h3>Centralized Call Center</h3>
						<h4>Centralized order taking and processing, increases revenue</h4>
						<p>Centralized food ordering management system via telephones. Operators on the phone can take orders from customers and punch them in the system. Orders are transferred to the outlet in the closest proximity to the customer for quick and efficient delivery.</p>
						<h3>Quick Deployment</h3>
						<h4>Quick implementation, minimal IT expertise</h4>
						<p>FusionResto can import master data, transactional data and reports from other systems to get started. It supports the import of data from Excel, CSV, TAB and XML. The templates provided by the implementation team helps you build correct master data in no time. The super easy user interface helps you to train new operators in minimal time.</p>
						<h3>Franchise Management</h3>

Transfer or Sell products and materials to franchisees directly from the FusionResto system. Maintain different pricing for different groups of franchisees or different geographical regions. Franchisees can raise indents and you can issue invoices for the purchased items.

With a few taps, you can see the performance of your business, and let you zoom-in to see the details of every transaction at every outlet of your enterprise. All of the information is displayed in a simple and actionable format right on your mobile device to help you make informed business decisions.</p>
						<h3>Regular Update</h3>
						<h4>Keeps your system up to date, all the time</h4>
