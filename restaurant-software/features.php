                        <h4>Strict controls and processes to avoid malpractices</h4>
                        <p>Voids and discounts are bitter realities in the F&amp;B business. The staffs need to be empowered with these functions to satisfy the guest, but these rights are often abused. With FusionResto, you can grant some users the rights to void and discount. All the voids and discounts are fully secured and controlled by designation-based security.</p>
