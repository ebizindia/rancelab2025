						<h3>Time and Attendance</h3>
						<h4>Keeps your employees motivated</h4>
						<p>A significant amount of your gross sales goes into employee salary and benefits, depending upon the size of the establishment you’re running. Your payroll costs should be low enough so that you can earn a profit but sufficient for your restaurant to run well and also to provide an enjoyable customer experience. Nothing motivates an employee more than getting paid on time. FusionResto Payroll Management System plays an important role by helping you perform calculations faster, process incentives and prepare pay-slips quicker and disburse payments on time. This keeps your employees motivated.</p>
						<h3>Employee Profile</h3>
						<h4>Builds a happy and motivated employee base</h4>
						<p>FusionResto payroll helps you to record employee profile, attendance and calculate the pay and deductions. It covers wages and salaries, overtime, commission, bonuses and holiday pay. It helps you pay your employees the correct amount on time, every time. You know what a dissatisfied employee means to the service-based hospitality industry. Demotivated and dissatisfied employees often lose focus from customer service. Working out details while computing the payment for staff is complex and time consuming. FusionResto payroll system helps you deal with payroll related events, such as if an employee is promoted or leaves the company.</p>
						<h3>Work Plan and Holiday List</h3>
						<h4>Works your plan and plans your work</h4>
						<p>Working out holiday entitlements can be a mind-boggling experience for many restaurant executives. With FusionResto, you can create a proper policy and process in-place. An effective work-plan roster helps in correct distribution of manpower throughout the operating hours, day or night.</p>
						<h3>Pay Head and Salary Structure</h3>
						<h4>Quickly builds scalable pay head and salary structure</h4>
						<p>Think about how long it takes your team to perform payroll tasks each week and month. It also takes a lot of time to track records, such as who was hired, when and at what pay structure. It is also required that someone keeps a record of attendance. At the time of weekly or monthly payment, it creates an additional pressure as everyone’s pay needs to be calculated with accuracy.</p>
						<h3>Attendance (Fingerprint or Smart Card)</h3>
						<h4>Captures and evaluates employee performance</h4>
						<p>A restaurant is a 24x7 business and the staff requirement is based on the occupancy. There are different types of employees with various work shifts, which makes it hard to keep track of attendance. Correct attendance recording is required to calculate the right pay and to analyse employee regularity, punctuality and other insights. FusionResto payroll comes with a fully configurable attendance system that can be used with highly secured fingerprint login or smart cards.</p>
						<h3>Pay Slip Generation</h3>
						<h4>Builds transparency, advocates loyalty</h4>
						<p>Employees often need to know how the pay has been calculated and they sometimes need documents for their home loan or other statutory requirement, as well. FusionResto helps you to easily print out the pay slip and pay-check in an easy to understand format. A duly printed or documented pay-slips often serves as a compulsory requirement to run a successful restaurant, because the government and law demands it.</p>
						<p>Also, other departments need certain analytical reports related to payroll, such as daily attendance sheets and pay sheets. With FusionResto, these reports are centralized and can be used by executives of other departments that have been granted access to.</p>
