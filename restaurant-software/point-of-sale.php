A new order ticket appears as soon as it is punched and followed by a loud buzzer so that it does not go unnoticed in a crowded and noisy kitchen. An automatic color change in the order display will alert the chef on the elapsed time and delays in the food preparation. Server gets the notification as the dish gets prepared so that customers can be served on time.</p>
