						<h3>Simplified Menu Management</h3>
						<h4>Build a profitable menu in minutes</h4>
						<p>Add, import, copy and organize all your menu items in single or multiple menus. Schedule your regular, special and festive menu according to day and time or shift. Make different menus for AC and non-AC sections. Route orders to various kitchen printers or kitchen displays by menu items or categories. Create open items, define item position, color codes and preparation time, setup and manage optional and auto-suggest modifiers and side dishes.</p>
						<h3>Digital Menu Tablet Menu</h3>
						<h4>Brings life to your menu</h4>
						<p>Elevate guest experience at your restaurant by completely replacing your paper menus with a digital menu. Describe each dish with beautiful pictures and descriptions tempting your guests enough to immediately place an order. Each dish can further be described with veg or non-veg, spicy, jain, chef special to make their ordering easy. Customers can place orders on tablets, which will be immediately available to servers and kitchen staff for further processing.</p>
						<h3>Combo and Offers</h3>
						<h4>Capitalize the value of your offerings</h4>
						<p>First of all, it makes your guests feel that they have saved money. Believe it, they actually have! With FusionResto, using a few clicks, an awesome combo can be made. Creating a combo menu is simple and easy, using new or existing items from the menu. You may choose low price and high margin items to be offered as a combo which can be fitted into almost any activity in the hospitality industry, with all kinds of menus. Guests can also choose to make their own customized combo. Combo attracts a group of diners and it increases average person cost and number of guests.</p>
						<h3>Captain Order Taking</h3>
						<h4>Enhance guest experience, improve staff efficiency</h4>
						<p>FusionResto’s order app is fully integrated with POS and kitchen display. Captains can take orders on smart phones or tablets at the table. All orders will be displayed immediately on the kitchen display or printed at respective food and beverage sections. It enhances the productivity of captains and helps them spend more time with guests, instead of running between floor and kitchen. It also helps them learn more about guest preferences and their feedback.</p>
						<h3>Forced Questions and Food Modifiers</h3>
						<h4>Improved captain ordering, enhance guest experience</h4>
						<p>Pre-define choice of options on menu items to avoid any mistakes while taking the guest order. Guests are most satisfied when their personal preferences are met. Someone may like a standard dish without mushrooms or garlic. Some guests may ask for a dish to be a bit spicier than usual. FusionResto ensure that the wait staff enter these modifiers and they are automatically printed on the KOT or displayed for the kitchen staff. It also supports forced questions that help to eliminate errors by asking a waiter to choose an answer while placing the order.</p>
						<h3>Built-in Void and Cancellation Reason</h3>
						<h4>Controls void and cancellation, reduces theft and wastage</h4>
						<p>Void and cancellations are an integral part of the food and beverage business. You do not want this to happen and at the same time, you have to honor this if it comes. Staff need to be empowered with these functions to satisfy the guest, but these rights are often abused. With FusionResto, it is easy to define different cancellation reasons and tag it back to inventory update in the system. It enables management to have due diligence on the employees as to why the items had been cancelled and restrict any type of misappropriations.</p>						 
						<h3>Happy Hour Pricing</h3>
						<h4>Acquire new customers, retain existing one</h4>
						<p>FusionResto makes you encash the slow business hours into profitable business hours with custom defined happy hours. With FusionResto, you can utilize happy hours in more than one way, like introducing new drinks, offering special rates, extending buy one get one offers to regular loyal guests. These hours can also be utilized to introduce or invite new members and enjoy special services or items at special rates. This will help acquire new customers and retain new ones.</p>
