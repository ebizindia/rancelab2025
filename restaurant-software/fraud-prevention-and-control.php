						<h3>Secured Login</h3>
						<h4>Most secured and granular level security</h4>
						<p>RanceLab has multiple methods and levels of robust security ensuring zero tampering to your data. From manual login credentials to magnetic cards and from highly secure chip cards to most secure fingerprint login, FusionResto has everything to ensure zero unauthorised access to the system. Each session and logins are recorded and can be viewed at a later stage to identify and surface any malpractices. </p>
						<h3>Auto Check-out</h3>
						<h4>Protects proxy entries</h4>
						<p>Whenever a user is away from his workstation leading to inactivity, RanceLab automatically logs him out of the system. This process significantly reduces system exposure to data breach. Auto check-out also protects the user from getting proxy entries added or in the worst case modified or deleted using his / her credentials.</p>
						<h3>Team System</h3>
						<h4>Keeps teams collaborated, saves from work duplicacy</h4>
						<p>Built-in team system enables system administrators to create different teams thereby allowing selected users to view or work on specific data. With team-system different user groups will have access to various sets of data pertaining to different departments or geography. For example, the finance team will have access to records limited to accounts or Kolkata team will have access to records limited to Kolkata location.</p>
						<h3>Role Based Access Control (RBAC)</h3>
						<h4>Multi level user roles and rights</h4>
						<p>Role-based access control (RBAC) allows a predefined access to a user’s role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that users have on the system. Users are only allowed to access the information necessary to effectively perform their job duties. Access can be based on several factors, such as authority, responsibility, and job competency. In addition, access to computer resources can be limited to specific tasks such as the ability to view, create, modify or print.</p>
						<h3>User Based Menu</h3>
						<h4>User based menu for specific purposes</h4>
						<p>User-based Menu allows users to view selected menu items in the system. As a result, their scope to access the system gets limited. It reduces the administrative work and IT support, maximizes operational efficiency and improves compliance. With user-based menus in place, lower-level users do not have the privilege to access a few menu items or to sensitive data. This is especially helpful if you have many users. Using a user based menu will help in securing your company’s sensitive data.</p>
						<h3>Activity & Audit Trail</h3>
						<h4>Tracks and reports all activities and sessions</h4>
						<p>The goal of any user activity monitoring is to find and filter out actionable information that’s valuable in data protection efforts. With effective processes in place, RanceLab immediately detects and surfaces suspicious user activity for you to investigate further. You can also find out what users are adding, modifying or even deleting. User activity monitoring is also helpful in ensuring that users do not access the system outside your domain or premises.</p>
						<h3>Data Health Analysis</h3>
						<h4>Tracks and reports all data health</h4>
						<p>Analysis shows how many records (masters and transactions) were edited, deleted and re-printed along with user details, involved in the activity. This details also checks all the necessary links and updates the health of the locations connected, data status, activity report of edited master records, different logs, data summary and logged-in user reports. It tracks and highlights unusual activity and assists administrators in resolving the same. Built-in database management tools assist system administrators in keeping the data health in optimized condition.</p>
						<h3>KOT and Void Analysis</h3>
						<h4>Tracks and reports all KOT and cancelled KOT</h4>
						<p>RanceLab tracks down to each line item in each single KOT punched by the users from various POS terminals or handheld devices. The KOT consists of details such as table number, covers, name of the server, date, time, items ordered, and its quantity. Usually, all the KOTs are serially numbered for control purposes. RanceLab checks for any duplicate or cancel KOT with users involved in the activity so that the food controller can take proper action on it. It also carries customer remarks in case of cancellation by the customer so that the kitchen and chef knows the actual reason and improves further.</p>
