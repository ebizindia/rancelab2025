/*! 
* Enter the JS function/s you want to be able to call after the main page 
* or individual topics load in this file. The functions are made available 
* by this file but called by the POSTLOAD_TOPICFUNC and POSTLOAD_PAGEFUNC
* variables. 
*  
* Nothing in this file should be executed on loading! All execution is
* initiated with a single statement stored in the POSTLOAD_PAGEFUNC and
* POSTLOAD_TOPICFUNC variables, in the General Settings variables group. 
*
* POSTLOAD_PAGEFUNC: Statement to be executed ONCE on loading the main page.
* POSTLOAD_TOPICFUNC: Statement to be executed on EVERY page load
* 
* The statement/s you enter POSTLOAD_PAGEFUNC will be executed after 
* all page components and assets have loaded, including images.
* 
* The statement/s in POSTLOAD_TOPICFUNC are executed after topic content
* has been dynamically replaced in the page when the user browses to a new
* topic.
